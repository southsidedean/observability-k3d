# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (unreleased)

The start of the rebuild as ok3d. This release sets up the project itself; the stack arrives
in 0.4. [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) has the roadmap.

### Changes

- CI checks every pull request: lint and security checks for the scripts, the Python, and the
  workflows, and the tests on Linux and macOS. CodeQL, dependency review, and OpenSSF
  Scorecard run alongside.
- Git hooks refuse a commit on `main`, your own settings files, secrets, private names, and
  images nobody has looked at. Turn them on with `git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.
- Tests check that nothing in the repository describes a real home network, that every link
  in the docs leads somewhere, and that no test reaches the network.
- Renovate keeps the pinned versions current.
- `tests/vm/cloud-init.yaml` makes the test VM: a generic Ubuntu server with ok3d's
  prerequisites.
- `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and templates for pull requests and issues.

## 0.2.0 (2026-10-27)

The old stack's last version, before the rebuild replaces it. A review found that it
collected metrics but couldn't tell anyone about a problem: alerts went nowhere, the UniFi
alert rules used metrics that don't exist, the probes weren't scraped, and syslog never
arrived. [PLAN.md](PLAN.md) lists every finding.
